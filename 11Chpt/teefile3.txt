Sunday is over
We are all going home
No reason to stay here
But no one has made a move
We know that for sure
Nothing lasts forever
But we have too many things
Gone too fast
Let's make a wish
Easy one
That you are not the only one
And someone's there
Next to you holding your hands
- ELLEGARDEN "Make A Wish"
